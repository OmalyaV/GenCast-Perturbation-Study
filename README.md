This research investigates whether **physically-aware perturbations** introduced at inference time can improve the **ensemble diversity** and **probabilistic skill** of the diffusion-based weather forecasting model **GenCast** (DeepMind, 2024).

While GenCast achieves state-of-the-art deterministic forecasts, ensemble realism depends on the structure of **initial-condition (IC) perturbations**.  
This repository provides reproducible experiments analyzing several perturbation strategies applied to the GenCast inference pipeline.
